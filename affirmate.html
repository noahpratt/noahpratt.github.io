            <p>Affirmate is a capstone project completed during my final term of Global Business and Digital Arts at the University of Waterloo. It was created with the support, hard-work, and humility of my closest friends, and serves as a great cap to four years of determination. From concept to deliverable, this project was created within four months and a global pandemic.</p>

          <h2>The challenge</h2>
          <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1000x300">
          <p>Affirmate all started with the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" class="link" target="_blank">United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs)</a>. My course, GBDA402 was concerned with growing an idea to be a fully crafted concept for a socially-conscious business. And like all great concepts, it starts with some research. I started by diving into research of SDG-3, <i>Good Health and Well-Being</i>. More specifically, I was interested in SDG-3.5, which aims to strengthen the prevention and treatment of abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol. I was drawn to the many <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/covid-19-mental-health-substance-use-1.5829149  https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/covid-19-self-isolation-a-problem-for-those-in-addiction-recovery-1.5506357" class="link" target="_blank">connections between Mental Health and Substance abuse</a>. What surprised me most was the was that substance abuse can commonly be drawn from underlying mental health concerns which are further stimulated by negative feedback loops.</p>
          <div class="showcase-flex">
            <img src="img/Affirmate/habit-loop.jpg">
            <div>
              <h4>The Habit Loop</h4>
              <p>Popularized in Charles Duhigg's book <i><a href="https://charlesduhigg.com/books/the-power-of-habit/" class="link" target="_blank">The Power of Habit</a></i>, a habit loop explains how the actions we preform on routine are coordinated by Cues (which signify a need), Routines (actions to fulfil the need), and Rewards (the feelings or reactions post routine). However, some habit loops are defined by only some actions:</p>
              <table>
                <tr>
                  <td>Cue</td>
                  <td>Routine</td>
                  <td>Reward</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Feeling Mentally Unwell</td>
                  <td>?</td>
                  <td>Feeling Mental Relief</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>For Mental Health and Substance Abuse, the gap to meet positive reward is commonly filled by unhealthy means.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>In the end, we always meet our needs in either healthy or unhealthy ways. Moreover, for those looking to find healthier alternatives such as group support, would have <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/covid-19-self-isolation-a-problem-for-those-in-addiction-recovery-1.5506357" class="link" target="_blank">grately decreased options due to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic</a>. Motivated by my research, I was set with a goal:</p>
          <h3 style="max-width: 75%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">How might we reduce harmful use of alcohol & substances within adults by improving connection and mental health while distanced?</h3>
          <p>After that, it was time to get creative! Our task was to organize our research, thoughts, and ideas into an organized package ... all on a ceral box! Here you'll see some original environment analysis, user journey map, Jobs-To-Be-Done, and ideas.</p>
          <div class="aff-idea-box">
            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="img/Affirmate/idea-box-1.png" alt="" height="300">
            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="img/Affirmate/idea-box-2.png" alt="" height="300">
            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="img/Affirmate/idea-box-3.png" alt="" height="300">
            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="img/Affirmate/idea-box-4.png" alt="" height="300">
            <div id="myModal" class="modal">
              <span class="close">&times;</span>
              <img class="modal-content" id="img01">
              <div id="caption"></div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>This also lead me to my original value proposition to key users: "helps me feel human, and that my pain is worth healing". Up until this point, the work had been individual. All groups had been working separately to come up with an idea to pitch to our team, then we would decide on a concept or direction which spoke to us all. We all had an interest in a wellness based platform, with a focus on a more approachable or casual focus.</p>

          <h2>Personas</h2>
          <p>Our goal around personas was to craft personas that served to our users' intentions and actions. <a href="https://medium.com/uxr-content/your-personas-probably-suck-heres-how-you-can-build-them-better-b2b32a45c93b" class="link" target="_blank">This article really influenced our work!</a> We started by creating a Google form to get more insight about how people approach mental health. We based our questions on what motivates people, what gets them out of bed in the morning, and what keeps them up at night. By learning how people approach their days and relate to others, we developed personas to help fill in the gaps.</p>
          <p>After getting lots of form results, we brought them into Miro, and grouped them into common themes:</p>
          <div class="aff-idea-box">
            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="img/Affirmate/persona-1.png" alt="" height="300">
            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="img/Affirmate/persona-2.png" alt="" height="300">
            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="img/Affirmate/persona-3.png" alt="" height="300">
            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="img/Affirmate/persona-4.png" alt="" height="300">
            <img class="myImages" id="myImg" src="img/Affirmate/persona-5.png" alt="" height="300">
            <div id="myModal" class="modal">
              <span class="close">&times;</span>
              <img class="modal-content" id="img01">
              <div id="caption"></div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>When we grouped and organized our research, we found a few common trends, and crafted our four personas from there:</p>
          <div class="persona-grid">
            <div>
              <h3>The Connector</h3>
              <p>Energy derived from others</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>The Perserverer</h3>
              <p>A positive day is one with no negatives</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>The Planner</h3>
              <p>Planning is important</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>The Doubter</h3>
              <p>Spends time worrying</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>When we had all of this initial research and understanding of our user base together, we got started.</p>

          <p><i>Trying things out</i></p>
          <p>By this point, we had been noodling on our ideas for a couple weeks, and it was time to get things going! We all knew we wanted to create an approachable wellnes platform. An opportunity outlined from our persona analysis was to leverage <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/daily-affirmations/" class="link" target="_blank">personal affirmations</a>. Affirmations are little bites of positive messaging with the goal to boost your mindset, and give direction to how you go about your day.</p>

          <h2>My Solution</h2>
          <p>During my time working at Trualta, I've been able to make some really exciting things! Below is just a few of the things I've been up to.</p>

          <h3>Customizable Marketing Kit</h3>
          <p>Tools Used: Canva, Photoshop, InDesign</p>
          <img src="img/trualta/marketing.png">
          <p>One of my key projects has been creating customizable marketing kits for partner agencies to effectively communicate the benefits Trualta can make in their lives. A big challenge of Trualta is that we can make the platform as wonderful and purposeful to the end user, but it is the case manager who needs to market our product for us for it to be successful. Chances are, they don't have too much of a design and marketing background, and that's where my expertise came in!</p>
          <p>After searching through options online, I realized that it would be best if we could simply give case managers a library of marketing assets to support their efforts in marketing our product to their clients. This helped to not only have the case managers feel their needs supported, but this also helped to increase traffic to the portal.</p>

          <h3>2-Step Registration</h3>
          <p>Tools Used: Adobe XD, Balsamiq, Photoshop, Miro</p>
          <img src="img/trualta/registration.png">
          <p>A larger product design project of mine has been to restructure the registration process to be more open and accommodating to the caregivers. Before this project, our portal suited the needs of the user, but felt clinical. Moreover, when the family member signed up for Trualta, they would be greeted with a large registration form asking for all of their info. Instead, we looked for more welcoming opportunities of registration to not only help our caregivers get onto the platform, but to keep them coming back.</p>
          <p>We did this by restructuring our registration flow to welcome the user. Now, when users register with Trualta, they start with a welcome video explaining the benefits of Trualta, then provide basic info like name and email. After that, the caregivers set their intention of using Trualta. This way, their motivations for the platform is brought to the forefront, and they feel prepared for the platform. Next, they pick the topic they are interested in, and they are ready to go. Later, users are asked to fill in any required info to complete registration, after they feel comfortable to do so.</p>

          <h3>Video</h3>
          <p>Tools Used: Vimeo, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition</p>
          <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/481880435"  frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>There's been quite a few video projects I've played a part in at Trualta. Before starting, they had next to no video material. Throughout my time at Trualta, I've created a video intro and template for our video content. From there, I've animated, provided voice over, and overall developed many different video for case managers, caregivers, partner investors, and more.</p>

          <h3>Virtual Tradeshow</h3>
          <p>Tools Used: WordPress, Photoshop, HTML/CSS</p>
          <img src="img/trualta/virtual-tradeshow.gif">
          <p>A different sort of challenge faced at Trualta through COVID-19 is that our outreach conferences have been moved online! Typically Trualta would use our existing tradeshow booth, however we were met with a new opportunity. I had to develop a virtual tradeshow booth within WordPress that not only communicated the value of Trualta to potential agencies, but a virtual tradeshow booth that stood out among the crowd. To complete this project, I reorganized and compiled existing graphics I had developed, then implemented them into WordPress, along with custom HTML & CSS to disrupt the traditional booth designs at the show. This project resulted in Trualta having a tradeshow booth that not only would work at the conference, but could also be applied on our site for demo acquisition.</p>

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <img src="img/trualta/learn.png">
          <p>As some more background on the project, I worked this fully remote, but the quality of team made it feel like we weren't so far apart. Working at Trualta gave me some strong insight to what I value into what I value most within a career. An ideal career to me is one where I feel valued, when I feel my work is of value to both the organization and to a larger calling, and where there is a strong understanding of a healthy work – life balance; and Trualta has been a shining showcase for that to me.</p>
