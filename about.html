      <div>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid, I knew I wanted to push buttons and put words onto a screen. Okay maybe not exactly that, </p>
        <p>I&#39;m a motivated and hardworking individual, with a passion for helping others. I achieve my goals through perseverance, commitment, and responsibility. I get results by being a strong team member, learning by experience. and dedication in all roles. I volunteer on a global and local scale, and have been recognized as an outstanding member of the community.

        <br><br>

        I'm Noah, a 3rd year Global Business and Digital Arts student at the University of Waterloo. A sleepless student, creative thinker, and overall curious as to how things work.

        <br><br>

        I have a strong curiosity, and a passion for learning, currently holding a 4.0GPA. I have experience on all mainstream Adobe CC programs, HTML/CS & JS, Project Management, branding on a global scale, and I'm actively looking to learn more!</p>
