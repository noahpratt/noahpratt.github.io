        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        <p>In early 2020, I’m looking for internship opportunities over the summer months at tech and design companies alike.</p>
        <p>Most internships nowadays within UX, Front-End Design, and tech require a portfolio.</p>
        <p><i>Percentage of places which require a portfolio, show in graph</i></p>
        <p>One of InVision’s top outlooks for 2020 is for business designers. Those with the heart of a designer, head of a business, hands to make things happen!</p>

      <section id="progress">
        <h2>Some of my progress</h2>
        <p>Overall, the process of finding an internship can be intimidating. My first assumption of a portfolio site was that it is simply a showcase of the things a person has made, and I really doubted myself if what I’ve made is good enough to get hired.</p>
        <p>Honestly, a really good resource in the development of my website was Cofolio.com. My friend Alyssa (LINKEDIN LINK) told me it was a showcase of people who found internships at major companies and the portfolio sites which helped to get them there. Looking through them, I was blown away at some of the works people were up to, and it was humbling to see the honesty and individuality of each person.</p>
        <p>At the start of this project, I knew I had the capabilities to press the right buttons to have words display on the screen, but what I really wanted to show was my heart.</p>
        <p>The true version one of my portfolio website came out of my beginner HTML/CSS course for school. It really taught me the framework of how to build a webpage, and started my interested in Web Design.</p>
